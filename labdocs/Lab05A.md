# Lab 5A: Working with Environments

All Python code runs in the context of an environment, which determines the Python packages available. When you run a script as an experiment in Azure Machine Learning, you can configure the environment in which it runs.

## Before You Start

Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md) and [Lab 1B](Lab01B.md), which include tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other resources used in this lab.

## Task 1: Work with Environments

In this task, you'll use code in a notebook to work with environments for Azure Machine Learning experiments.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, start your compute instance.
2. When the compute instance is running, refresh the Azure Machine Learning studio web page in your browser to ensure your authenticated session has not expired. Then click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **Users/DP100** folder, open the **05A - Working with Environments.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
4. When you have finished running the code in the notebook, on the **File** menu, click **Close and Halt** to close it and shut down its Python kernel. Then close all Jupyter browser tabs.
5. In Azure Machine Learning studio, on the **Compute** page, select your compute instance and click **Stop** to shut it down.
